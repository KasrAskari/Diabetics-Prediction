# Diabetics Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning models trained on medical datasets. By analyzing key health metrics such as glucose levels, blood pressure, and BMI, the system provides an accurate risk assessment to support early diagnosis and treatment planning.

## Features

- Diabetes risk prediction using supervised machine learning models.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering for improved model performance.
- Visualization of correlations between health metrics and diabetes risk.
- Interactive interface or scripts for prediction based on user input.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from [Kaggle - diabetes2]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kandij/diabetes-dataset) (or another dataset source). It contains medical data such as:

- Glucose levels
- Blood pressure
- BMI
- Insulin levels
- Family history of diabetes

## Algorithms Used

1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Random Forest**
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
4. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

---

## Results

The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of approximately **85-90%** on the test dataset, demonstrating its reliability in diabetes prediction.
